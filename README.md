# University-Projects

This is a small sampling of a couple of larger projects I worked on for my CS degree at UMKC

The first is a text recreation of Monopoly using C++ and focuses on group work and object oriented programming.
A link to the original group repository can be found here

The second is a small Unity game created in the Unity engine and programmed using C# scripts. It is a physics puzzle game modeled after the board game of the same name.
