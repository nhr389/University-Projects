Game Feature Description:
SOS is a 2 player board game where players try to spell out SOS as many times as they can to score
The game can be played with two players, two computers, or one of each
Turns and outcomes can be written to an output file
The size of the play grid can be chosen between 1 and 10 (1 and 2 will always result in draw)
There are two ways to play, simple and general
- Simple: The first player to spell SOS wins
- General: Players take turns until the board is filled and the player with the most SOS scores, wins

- Rules: Players take turns and can choose to play S or O in the grid
- The player that spells SOS gets 1 point
- If a player scores at least one point in a turn they get another turn
